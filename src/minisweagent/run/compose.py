"""Single source of truth for composing the task body handed to the main agent.

Before this module existed the task body was assembled in two very different
places depending on mode:

  - **fixed**   — inside ``cli.py`` by concatenating the user prompt
    with ``assemble_memory_context`` output.  One prompt replicated
    across N parallel agents.  (Legacy name: "homogeneous".)
  - **planned** — inside the planned-mode orchestrator and task generator,
    by calling out to the planner LLM, which produced per-task bodies
    that already included the commandment and user constraints.  N
    planned strategies, one per worker.  (Legacy name: "heterogeneous".)

Both modes eventually fed identical downstream stages (``ParallelAgent`` ->
``OptimizationAgent``), so the divergence was purely presentational.  This
module centralizes the composition in one function so that:

  - new modes (``auto`` routes per round; ``translate`` runs verify-retry)
    get a consistent entrypoint,
  - cross-session memory injection is applied identically,
  - the KernelLanguage-system-prompt binding (Triton / HIP / ...) is resolved
    in exactly one place.

The function deliberately does not call the planner LLM.  In ``planned``
mode it assembles the *base* task body shared by every planner sub-task;
the planner itself still lives in ``task_generator.py`` and is invoked
from ``run/unified.py``.

Mode vocabulary (matches the end-state execution plan):

  - ``fixed``   — one task body, replicated across ``num_parallel`` copies
  - ``planned`` — N planner-generated task bodies (one per strategy)
  - ``auto``    — controller picks ``fixed``-vs-``planned`` per round

Translation (source→target language) is NOT a ``run_pipeline`` mode.  It is
a **conditional preprocess phase** that runs before the optimization
loop when ``target_language ≠ source_language``; after it completes,
``ctx.kernel_path`` and ``ctx.language`` are swapped to the translated
kernel and the pipeline continues (or exits, if the user passed
``--translate-only``).  The phase owns its own narrow ``TranslationAgent``
subagent (a ``SubagentBase`` subclass with a verify-retry loop against
golden tensors); it does NOT reuse ``OptimizationAgent``.
