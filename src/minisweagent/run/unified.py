"""Unified pipeline entry for fixed + planned + auto modes.

All three modes run the SAME ``OptimizationAgent`` class on each worker.
The only thing that differs is the **task body** each worker receives:

  - ``fixed``   — one task body, replicated across ``num_parallel`` copies.
                  Variance comes from LLM sampling alone.  Good when the
                  language or problem already has strong priors (e.g. HIP
                  kernels with a single obvious optimization axis).
  - ``planned`` — A planner LLM emits N diverse strategy prompts, one
                  per worker.  Good when the search space is large and
                  distinct strategies are likely to find different optima
                  (e.g. Triton kernels with many viable tiling choices).
  - ``auto``    — Default.  Currently a static language-based router
                  (Triton→planned, HIP→fixed); the next iteration will
                  replace this with an adaptive mixed-mode controller
                  (seed with 2 planned + 2 fixed in round 1, then pick
                  the per-round ratio based on which variant produced
                  the best speedup so far).

The legacy "homogeneous" / "heterogeneous" terminology is an artifact of
pre-refactor code that had separate agent CLASSES for each dispatch
style.  With the unified ``OptimizationAgent`` those names no longer
describe anything real — the worker class is the same; only the task
body differs.  All public APIs and logs now use ``fixed`` / ``planned``.

NOTE on translation: source→target language translation is NOT a
``run_pipeline`` mode.  It is a **conditional preprocess phase**
(``preprocess/phases/translation.py``, not yet implemented) that runs
BEFORE the optimization loop when the user requests a target language
different from the source.  Translation owns its own ``TranslationAgent``
subagent (a standalone ``SubagentBase`` subclass with a verify-retry
loop against golden tensors) and does not reuse ``OptimizationAgent``.
After the phase completes, ``ctx.kernel_path`` and ``ctx.language`` are
swapped to the translated kernel and the normal fixed/planned/auto
pipeline continues.

``run_pipeline`` is responsible for resolving the tool set, composing the
task body (via ``run/compose.py``), and dispatching to the shared pool
runner.  ``_run_fixed`` drives the round loop for fixed mode directly,
while ``_run_planned`` delegates to ``run_orchestrator`` (whose
``run_planned_orchestrator`` internals own the round loop already).
