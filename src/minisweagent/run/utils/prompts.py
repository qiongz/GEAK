PARSE_TASK_INFO_USER_TEMPLATE = """Analyze the following optimization task and extract configuration information.

Extract the following information (return null if not found):
1. kernel_name: The name of the kernel/function being optimized (e.g., "gemm", "matmul", "conv2d")
2. kernel_url: The kernel URL or local path if provided
3. kernel_type: Kernel type, strictly one of "hip", "triton", or "other"
4. repo: The repository path mentioned in the task (absolute path or relative path)
5. test_command: The command to run tests or benchmarks
5b. test_harness: Path or URL to a USER-PROVIDED test/benchmark HARNESS FILE.
   Look for phrases like "Use the test harness at <path>", "test harness:
   <path>", "use harness <path>", "harness file <path>", "with the harness
   at <path>".  This is a SINGLE FILE the user wants the pipeline to use
   verbatim — DIFFERENT from test_command (which is a shell command).
   Set null if the user only described a command but no harness file.
   When BOTH a test_command and a test_harness are mentioned, populate
   both — they're complementary (the harness is the file; the command
   is one way to invoke it).
6. metric: The performance metric to measure (e.g., "bandwidth in GB/s", "latency in ms", "throughput")
7. num_parallel: Number of parallel optimization agents to run (integer).
   If the user did not explicitly state a number but specified a GPU list,
   you MAY leave this null — the pipeline will auto-derive it as
   ``len(gpu_ids)``.  Only set this when the user explicitly says
   "N parallel" / "N workers" etc.
8. gpu_ids: GPU IDs for parallel execution.  Accept any of these forms
   verbatim from the user's prompt:
     - "0,1,2,3"   (comma-separated list)
     - "4-7"       (range, inclusive — e.g., "Use GPUs 4-7" → "4-7")
     - "0,1,4-7"   (mixed)
     - "4"         (single GPU)
   Prefer the FORM the user used (don't expand "4-7" into "4,5,6,7"
   unnecessarily — downstream parsing handles both).
9. output_dir: Directory path where output logs and artifacts should be saved (e.g., "outputs/topk_run", "/workspace/results")
10. model: Model name or identifier to use (e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "gpt-4o")
11. config: Path to a YAML configuration file (e.g., "configs/my_setup.yaml", "/path/to/config.yaml")

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with these keys. Example:
{{
  "kernel_name": "matmul",
  "kernel_url": "https://github.com/org/repo/blob/main/kernel.py",
  "kernel_type": "triton",
  "repo": "/path/to/repo",
  "test_command": "python test.py",
  "test_harness": "/path/to/test_kernel_harness.py",

  "num_parallel": 4,
  "gpu_ids": "0,1,2,3",
  "output_dir": "outputs/matmul_run",
  "model": null,
  "config": null
}}

If any field cannot be determined from the task, set it to null.

PARSE_PIPELINE_PARAMS_USER_TEMPLATE = """Analyze the following task and extract GPU kernel optimization pipeline parameters.

Extract the following (return null if not found or not applicable):
1. kernel_url: The path or URL to the SPECIFIC KERNEL FILE to optimize (e.g., "/path/to/silu.hip", "/workspace/kernels/matmul.py", "https://github.com/org/repo/blob/main/kernel.py"). This is the kernel source file itself, NOT the repository root directory.
2. preprocess_dir: Path to a directory containing existing preprocessing artifacts (e.g., "/path/to/geak_output"). Only set if the user explicitly mentions reusing existing artifacts.
3. mode: Execution mode for the optimization run.  One of:
     - "fixed"   — run the same task body across N parallel agents (identical copies).  Set if the user asks for replicated / parallel / best-of-N runs of a single strategy.
     - "planned" — let the planner LLM generate N diverse strategies and run each in its own agent.  Set if the user asks for "diverse strategies", "planner", or wording that suggests multiple distinct approaches.
     - "auto"    — let the pipeline pick fixed vs planned.  This is the default; only set another value if the user is explicit.
   Return null if the user is not explicit about the mode.
   Legacy terms: "heterogeneous" should map to "planned"; "homogeneous" to "fixed".
   NOTE: Do NOT emit "translate" here.  Translation is a separate preprocess phase triggered by ``target_language`` (field 7 below), not a pipeline mode.
4. max_rounds: Maximum number of optimization rounds (integer). Only set if explicitly mentioned.
5. start_round: Round number to resume from (integer, 1-based). Only set if explicitly mentioned.
6. pipeline_intent: true if the task describes kernel optimization, performance improvement, GPU kernel work, or profiling. false if it describes general coding tasks like bug fixes, refactoring, or feature additions.
7. target_language: Target kernel language if the user asks to translate / port / convert the kernel (e.g. "triton", "hip", "cuda").  Only set if the user is explicit about wanting translation.  Null otherwise.  When set, the pipeline runs a translation preprocess phase before optimization.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Example:
{{{{
  "kernel_url": "/workspace/repo/kernels/silu.hip",
  "preprocess_dir": null,
  "mode": null,

EXTRACT_USER_CONSTRAINTS_TEMPLATE = """Analyze the following optimization task and extract mandatory constraints and prescribed optimization directives.

Extract TWO categories:

1. **constraints**: Hard rules that MUST NOT be violated (rejection criteria).
   Look for:
   - Function name constraints ("function name MUST be exactly X", "do NOT rename")
   - Signature constraints ("function signature MUST be identical")
   - Numerical correctness requirements ("output must be numerically identical")
   - Compatibility constraints ("keep all template parameters compatible")
   - Forbidden actions ("do NOT modify the test harness")
   - Any other explicit MUST / MUST NOT / DO NOT rules

2. **directives**: Prescribed optimization strategies that agents SHOULD follow as their primary approach, while retaining freedom to explore additional directions beyond these.
   Look for:
   - Specific optimization strategies ("tune block sizes", "optimize shared memory usage")
   - Memory access guidance ("improve memory coalescing", "vectorize loads/stores")
   - Architecture-specific tuning ("tune for MI355X gfx950 304 CUs")
   - Performance targets ("close efficiency gap toward 75-100% of peak HBM bandwidth")

Do NOT extract:
- Hardware descriptions without an actionable directive
- Model-level or end-to-end profiling numbers (e.g., "89.72 ms across 12288 invocations",
  "4.77% of total GPU compute time", "38.57% of 8.0 TB/s peak HBM bandwidth"). These come
  from full-model benchmarking under different conditions and MUST NOT be used as baselines
  for comparison. GEAK runs its own isolated baseline measurements.
- Workload context descriptions ("LLM inference serving", "decode path")
- File paths or kernel identifiers

IMPORTANT: Performance targets like "close efficiency gap toward 75-100% of peak bandwidth"
are valid directives. But absolute numbers from the user's profiling (durations, invocation
counts, efficiency percentages) are NOT — they reflect a different measurement environment.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Example:
{{
  "constraints": [
    "The output function name MUST be EXACTLY: topkGatingSoftmax. Do NOT rename it.",
    "The function signature MUST be IDENTICAL to the original.",
    "Output must be numerically identical to the original."
  ],
  "directives": [
    "Tune block sizes and wave occupancy for MI355X gfx950 (304 CUs).",
    "Optimize shared memory (LDS) usage for expert gating softmax.",
    "Improve memory coalescing for top-k routing output writes."
  ]
